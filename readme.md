**Getting Started:**

Run the server... when you're in the parent directory:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

and then go to wherever your localhost server starts running

(i.e localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ etc... )

**Quick helpful tip, if you are creating a NEW Django project on Windows:**

This command may not work on windows
`django-admin startproject {name_of_your_app}`

Equivalent command for windows is:
`python -m django startproject {name_of_your_app}`

Group partners may not need to run this command, this is just a helpful tidbit.
